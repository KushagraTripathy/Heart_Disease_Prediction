Heart Disease Prediction System Using Machine Learning Models
Abstract
This project presents a Heart Disease Prediction System utilizing machine learning models implemented in Python and its associated frameworks. Following the data science lifecycle, we employ Python along with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for efficient data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The scikit-learn library is utilized for the development and evaluation of diverse machine-learning models, including Decision Trees and Random Forests.
The project commences with meticulous data collection and cleaning, addressing challenges such as missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, guiding informed feature engineering decisions. The iterative model development process involves applying various machine learning algorithms, ensuring a holistic approach to prediction accuracy.
Model performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The models are fine-tuned to achieve optimal predictive capabilities. Although the development of a user interface is not considered in this iteration, the predictive model can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems for automated heart disease risk assessments.
This project underscores the versatility of Python and its frameworks in facilitating a comprehensive data science workflow, showcasing the effectiveness of diverse machine learning models in the creation of a reliable Heart Disease Prediction System. The outcomes contribute to ongoing efforts in predictive healthcare analytics, offering valuable insights for preventive healthcare measures.
